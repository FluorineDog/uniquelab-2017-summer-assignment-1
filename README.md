# UniqueLab 2018 Spring Assignment 1, Part 2

## Implement set in C++ STL.
You are expected to implement: 
* insert(const T&)
* erase(const T&)
* clear()
* count(const T&) // return 1 if element exists, 0 otherwise
* empty()
* size()

Please refer to STL documents for details. 

Since time is short, you needn't implement 
features of templates or iterators. Just let T = double 
and change return values of most functions to void instead.

However, you must use **LLRB** for this assignment. 
 Any other balanced BSTs are not acceptable.
